    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-danger text-white">OBJECT</h3>
    <p>
        The first player to play all of the cards in their hand in each round scores points for the cards their opponents are left holding. The first player to score 500 points wins the game.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">SET UP</h3>
    <p>
        Each player draws a card. Player with the hightest point value is the dealer. Shuffle the deck. Each player is dealt 7 cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place the remaining cards facedown to form a DRAW pile. Turn over the top card of the DRAW pile to begin a DISCARD pile. If the top card is a Wild or Wild Draw 4, return it to the deck and pick another card. For all other cards, see directions that follow.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">SPECIAL CARDS</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Draw 2 Card</b> - When you play this card, the next persion to play must draw 2 cards and forfeit his/her turn. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player must draw two cards. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Draw 2 card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Reverse Card</b> - This card reverses direction of play. Play to the left now passes to the right, and vice versa. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the player to the right now plays first, and play then goes to the right instead of left. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Skip Card</b> - The next person in line to play after this card is played loses his/her turn and is "skipped." If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player (the player to the left of the dealer) is skipped. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Wild Card</b> - When you play this card, you may change the color being played to any color (including the current color) to continue play. You may play a Wild card even if you have another playable card in hand. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person to the left of the dealer chooses the color to begin play and plays the first card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Wild Draw 4 Card</b> - This card allows you to call the next color played and requires the next player to pick 4 cards from the DRAW pile and forfeit his/her turn. However, there is a hitch! You can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand that matches the color of the card previously played. If turned up at the beginning of play, return this card to the deck and pick another card. Note: A player may play a "Wild Draw Four" card even if they have a matching number or word card of a different color in their hand. If you suspect that a player has played a Wild Draw 4 card illegally, you may challenge them. A challenged player must show his/her hand to the player who challenged. If the challenged player is guilty, he/she must draw 4 cards. If the challenged player is not guilty, the challenger must draw the 4 cards, plus 2 additional cards. Only the person required to draw the 4 cards can make the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b style="color:#ff0000;">WHAT ARE THESE EXTRA CARDS FOR?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Blank Card</b> - This is a special card that you may use in one of two ways. If a card from your UNO deck is lost or damaged you may use the Blank Card as a replacement. Example: If you find that your deck is missing one of the yellow 7's you would simply replace it by taking the yellow Blank Card, marking a "7" on it and adding it back into the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your family has a special UNO rule your prefer to play with, you may write that rule on the Blank Cards and add them straight to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b style="color:#ff0000;">LET's PLAY!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Player to the left of the dealer plays first. Play passes to the left to start. Match the top card on the DISCARD pile either by number, color or word. For example, if the card is a Green 7, you must play a Green card or any color 7. Or, you may play any Wild card or a Wild Draw 4 card. If you don't have anything that matches, you must pick a card from the DRAW pile. If you draw a card you can play, play it. Otherwise, play moves to the next person. Before playing your next to last card, you must say "UNO." If you don't say UNO and another player catches you with just one card before the next player begins their turn you must pick FOUR more cards from the DRAW pile. If you are not caught before the next player either draws a card from the DRAW pile or draws a card from their hand to play, you do not have to draw the extra cards. Once a player plays their last card, the hand is over. Points are tallied (see Scoring section) and you start over again.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">GOING OUT</h3>
    <p>
        If you forget to say, "UNO" before your card touches the DISCARD pile, but you "catch" yourself before any other player catches you, you are safe and not subject to the 4-card penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may not catch a player for failure to say "UNO!" until his/her second-to-last card touches the DISCARD pile. Also, you may not catch a player for failure to say it after the next player begins his/her turn. "Beginning a turn" is defined as either drawing a card from the DRAW pile or drawing a card from your hand to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the last card played in a hand is a Draw 2 card or Wild Draw 4 card, the next player must draw 2 or 4 cards, depending upon the card played. These cards are counted when points are totaled.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no one is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, reshuffle the DISCARD pile and continue to play.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">SCORING</h3>
    <p>
        If you are first to get rid of all your cards, you get points for the cards left in the other players hands. Use the included score pad to record your score after each hand. Each card is worth the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table style="width:50%">
            <tr>
                <td>All number cards (0-9)</td>
                <td>Face Value</td>
              </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Draw 2</td>
                <td>20 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reverse</td>
                <td>20 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Skip</td>
                <td>20 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wild</td>
                <td>50 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wild Draw 4</td>
                <td>50 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Blank</td>
                <td>?</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        The WINNER is the first player to reach 500 points. However, the game may be scored by keeping a running total of the points each player is caught with at the end of each hand. When one player reaches 500 points, the player with the lowest points is the winner.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">RENEGING</h3>
    <p>
        You may choose not to play a playable card from your hand. If so, you must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be played, but you may not play a card from your hand after the draw.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-warning text-dark">TWO PLAYERS, PARTNERS AND MULTI-TABLE TOURNAMENTS</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Rules for Two Players</b> - The following special rules apply to two-player UNO:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.</b> Playing a Reverse card works like playing a Skip card. By playing the Reverse card, you immediately play another card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.</b> By playing a Skip card, you may immediately play another card.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3.</b> After playing a Draw 2 card or a Wild Draw 4 card, your opponent draws the number of cards indicated, and play is back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Partners - Four Players</b> - Sit across from your partner. When either partner goes out, the hand is over. Total all of the points in both opposing partners' hands and score for the winning team.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Variation</b> - With four players, play four hands with each of the other three players as your partner (a total of 12 hands). Each player keeps track of his/her points scored in each partnership. Play several rounds, with the person scoring the highest number of points declared the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        With eight players, play two seperate games at two tables, with each player having every other player as a partner for four hands each (a total of 28 hands). Score as above.
    </p>
    <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-warning text-dark">CHALLENGE UNO</h3>
    <p>
        This game is scored by keeping a running total of what each player is caught holding in his/her hand. As each player reaches a designated amount (500 is suggested), that player is eliminated from the game. When only two players are left in the game, they play head to head. (See Rules for Two Players above.) When a player reaches or exceeds the amount designated, they lose. The winner of that final hand is declared the winning player of the game. This variation is the most challenging to play.
